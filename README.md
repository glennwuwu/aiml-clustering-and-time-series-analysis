# Machine Learning Project: Clustering and Time Series Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my machine learning project, where I've explored two fascinating aspects of data analysis: **Clustering** and **Time Series Analysis**. In this project, I've leveraged advanced techniques to gain insights from data and make informed decisions.

## Time Series Analysis

### Dataset: Energy Consumption

In the Time Series Analysis section, I've worked with a dataset containing information on energy consumption. This dataset includes the following columns:

- **Gas Consumption (tons)**: Gas consumption in tons.
- **Electricity Consumption (MWh)**: Electricity consumption in MWh.
- **Water Consumption (tons)**: Water consumption in tons.

#### Key Highlights

- **Model Selection**: I've employed models from the `statsmodels` library, including those from the ARIMA family, as well as Exponential Smoothing models. These models are used to forecast future fluctuations in the energy consumption features.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Just as in the previous project, I've integrated the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to optimize hyperparameters, ensuring the accuracy of the time series forecasts.

- **Stationarity Tests**: To ensure the reliability of the time series models, I've conducted statistical tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test to check for stationarity in the data.

## Clustering

### Dataset: Customer Segmentation

In the Clustering section, I've aimed to group mall customers based on various factors, including:

- **Customer ID**: A unique ID assigned to each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **How Much They Spend**: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

#### Goal

The primary objective is to identify distinct customer segments within the mall's customer base, enabling the mall to tailor its marketing strategies and prioritize customer groups effectively.

#### Key Techniques

- **t-SNE Dimensionality Reduction**: I've employed t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cast higher-dimensional customer data into lower dimensions, making it easier to visualize and analyze the relationships between customers and their spending behavior.
